                MAKE BATTER Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and the salt in a
                medium bowl. Warm milk in the microwave or on top of the stove
                until lukewarm, not hot. You should be able to keep your finger
                submerged for 10 seconds. Whisk milk, egg, melted butter, and
                vanilla extract until combined. (By warming the milk slightly,
                the melted butter mixes into the milk instead of turning into
                small lumps). COOK PANCAKES Heat a large skillet (or use
                griddle) over medium heat. The pan is ready if when you splatter
                a little water onto the pan surface, the water dances around the
                pan and eventually evaporates. Make a well in the center of the
                flour mixture, pour milk mixture into the well and use a fork to
                stir until you no longer see clumps of flour. It is okay if the
                batter has small lumps â€“ it is important not to over-mix the
                batter. Lightly brush skillet with melted butter (this is
                optional if you have a high-quality non-stick pan). Use a
                1/4-cup measuring cup to spoon batter onto the skillet. Gently
                spread the batter into a 4-inch circle. When edges look dry, and
                bubbles start to appear and pop on the top surfaces of the
                pancake, turn over. This takes about 2 minutes. Once flipped,
                cook another 1 to 2 minutes or until lightly browned and cooked
                in the middle. Serve immediately with warm syrup, butter, and
                berries.
